# Architecture

A 5-minute mental model.

## Two packages

codenanny ships as two separately useful npm packages:

```
plugkit  ───▶  codenanny  ───▶  @codenanny/{ui, wizard, adapters, cli}
```

- **`plugkit`** is a neutral plugin contract for modular Express apps. ~200 LoC. Has zero codenanny in it. You can use it for any modular Node app.
- **`codenanny`** is the actual sessions/files/wizard product. It is *itself* a plugkit module.

The split means you can host codenanny inside an app that already uses plugkit for other modules, without any glue code.

## Two run modes

| Mode | What it does | When to use |
|---|---|---|
| **Live** | Long-running Express server. UI at `/app`, API under `/codenanny/api/`. Re-ingests on startup. | Daily driver. Run on your laptop, a VPS, or a Chromebook VM. |
| **Static export** | One-shot run. Builds a self-contained HTML+JSON bundle, ships to local / GDrive / SCP / FTP. | Snapshots, sharing, offline reading. |

The HTML wizard is the entry point for both. Picks the branch on step 1.

## Request lifecycle (live mode)

```
Browser
  │
  ▼
Express app  ◄── created by your host process
  │
  ├── /codenanny  ◄── plugkit-mounted codenanny router (HTTP API)
  │     │
  │     ▼
  │   createApi(db) ───▶ better-sqlite3 ───▶ codenanny.db
  │                          ▲
  │                          │ ingestAll() walks ~/.claude/projects/
  │                          │ on startup
  │                          │
  └── /app  ◄── static vanilla UI from @codenanny/ui
        │
        ▼
      fetch() ───▶ /codenanny/api/sessions, /search, /media, /stats, ...
```

## Request lifecycle (export mode)

```
codenanny export --dest <url>
  │
  ▼
ingestAll(db, src)         ◄── walk transcripts, write to a temp sqlite db
  │
  ▼
createApi(db).{sessions, projects, stats}   ◄── pull everything out as JSON
  │
  ▼
bundle = { generated_at, stats, projects, sessions: [...] }
  │
  ▼
getAdapter(destType).deliver(bundle, opts)
  │
  ├── local   ───▶ write index.html + index.json to <dir>
  ├── scp     ───▶ SFTP upload via ssh2-sftp-client
  ├── gdrive  ───▶ multipart upload via Google Drive REST API
  └── ftp     ───▶ (v0.2)
```

The bundle's `index.html` includes a tiny vanilla viewer that loads `index.json` and renders sessions + filter UI. Fully offline-searchable.

## Why sqlite + FTS5

- **Single file.** Easy to back up, easy to ship.
- **Native FTS.** FTS5 gives us fast cross-prompt search out of the box.
- **No daemon.** `better-sqlite3` is synchronous + in-process. No connection pool, no migration runner.
- **No vendor lock-in.** sqlite is everywhere. The schema is plain SQL in `packages/core/src/schema.sql`.

If you outgrow sqlite, you outgrow codenanny's positioning. That's fine — copy the schema, the ingest is pure functions, port it.

## Why plugkit at all

The repo has *one* product. Why pull out a separate package?

- **Discipline.** Forcing the plugin contract to be reusable kept codenanny from leaking host concerns into the module.
- **Reuse.** Anyone building a modular Express app can grab plugkit without taking codenanny.
- **Extension story.** Third parties can ship their own plugkit modules and run them in the same host process as codenanny.

The plugkit contract is intentionally tiny — five concerns, none of them required:

```js
defineModule({
  name,           // string, required
  mountPath,      // URL prefix for the router
  schema,         // { migrations: ['CREATE TABLE ...'] }
  router,         // ({ db, events, logger, host }) => express.Router
  subscribe,      // { 'some:event': handler }
  nav,            // { id, label, icon, route, roles?, source }
})
```

A module that just provides `schema` (no router) is fine. A module that just listens to events (`subscribe` only) is fine.

## Sessions ↔ projects ↔ files

```
projects (id, name, color, parent_dir)
  │
  │  1:N
  ▼
sessions (id, source_path, project_id, title, started_at, ended_at)
  │
  │  1:N           1:N
  ▼                 ▼
session_files    session_prompts
(path, action,    (role, ts, text)
 content_hash)      │
                    │  triggers
                    ▼
                 session_prompts_fts  (FTS5 mirror)
```

Projects are derived automatically on ingest — each subdirectory under the source root becomes one project. The user can rename them or reassign sessions from the UI.

## Delivery adapter contract

Each adapter exports:

```js
export async function deliver(bundle, opts) {
  // ... ship the bundle wherever
  return { location: 'human-readable destination' };
}
```

That's the whole surface. Adapters do not see the database, do not see the codenanny module — they take a bundle (JSON blob) and put it somewhere.

Adding a new adapter is one file. See [ADAPTERS.md](ADAPTERS.md).

## What is NOT in here

- No build step. Plain JS on Node 20+.
- No framework on the UI side. Vanilla HTML + a couple hundred lines of JS.
- No ORM. Hand-written SQL through `better-sqlite3`.
- No background workers. Ingest is synchronous and bounded by your transcript count.
- No multi-tenant. v1 is single-user.

These are deliberate. The point of codenanny is to be readable, hackable, and uninteresting to operate.
